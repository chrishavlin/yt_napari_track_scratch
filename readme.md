examples/prototypes of using the napari tracks layer with yt/ytree data 


### requirements

```
pip install yt ytree napari pyQT5 jupyterlab napari-arboretum
```

Note: on newer macbooks, `pyQT5` is a pain -- go with `pyQT6` (while note yet fully supported by napari, seems mostly functional in my limited use)

(might want `yt-napari` at some point?)
